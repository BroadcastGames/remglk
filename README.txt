RemGlk: remote-procedure-call implementation of the Glk IF API

RemGlk Library: version 0.2.1.

This is source code for an implementation of the Glk library which
supports structured input and output.

RemGlk does not provide a user interface. Instead, it wraps up the
application's output as a JSON data structure and sends it to stdout.
It then waits for input to arrive from stdin; the input data must also
be encoded as JSON.

RemGlk is therefore like CheapGlk, in that it works entirely through
input and output streams, and can easily be attached to a bot or web
service. However, unlike CheapGlk, RemGlk supports multiple Glk
windows and most Glk I/O features. Whatever it's attached to just has
to decode the structured output and display it appropriately.
